Pet Classification Project
This repository contains a deep learning project focused on pet classification using state-of-the-art neural networks. The goal of this project is to accurately classify images of various pet breeds, such as cats and dogs, using advanced machine learning techniques.

Project Overview
Pet classification is a challenging task due to the visual similarities between different pet breeds. The aim of this project is to develop a highly accurate classifier that can distinguish between different pet breeds with high precision. We leverage deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to achieve this objective.

Dataset
The project utilizes a diverse and well-curated dataset of pet images. The dataset consists of thousands of high-resolution images of different pet breeds, including cats and dogs. The dataset has been carefully labeled with corresponding breed information, enabling supervised learning techniques.

Model Architecture
Several popular CNN architectures, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, have been explored and implemented in this project. These models are known for their strong performance in image classification tasks. We experimented with different architectures to identify the best-performing one for our pet classification problem.

Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of deep learning models. In this project, we extensively explored various hyperparameter configurations to improve the model's accuracy. Parameters such as learning rate, batch size, dropout rate, and weight decay were carefully tuned using techniques like grid search and random search.

Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the trained models, we employed several commonly used evaluation metrics. The primary metric is accuracy, which measures the percentage of correctly classified pet images. Additionally, we also considered precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the models' performance across different pet breeds.

Results
After extensive hyperparameter tuning, we achieved remarkable results on the pet classification task. Our best-performing model achieved an accuracy of over 95% on the test set. The precision and recall scores were consistently high across various pet breeds. The trained model demonstrates the ability to accurately classify pets, which can be utilized in various applications, such as pet breed identification and pet-related services.
